# Graph Embedding Method Summary
Graph embedding is a widely used technique in both research and industry. In many cases, it proves to be a better encoding method than traditional one-hot encoding. There are many tasks within graph embedding, such as node embedding, community embedding and sub-structure embedding etc. And there are also many tasks can benefit from embedding, such as community detection.

## Node embedding technique
1. DeepWalk([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652.pdf))

## Measurement of embedding quality
1. Normalize Mutual Information([NMI](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6140sp15/7_locality_cluster/Assignment-6/NMI.pdf))

Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is a normalization of the Mutual Information (MI) score to scale the results between 0 (no mutual information) and 1 (perfect correlation).

2. Micro-averaged F1 score([Micro-F1](https://peltarion.com/knowledge-center/documentation/evaluation-view/classification-loss-metrics/micro-f1-score))

3. Macro-averaged F1 score
