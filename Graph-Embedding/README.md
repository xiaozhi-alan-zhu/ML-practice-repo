# Graph Embedding Method Summary
Graph embedding is a widely used technique in both research and industry. In many cases, it proves to be a better encoding method than traditional one-hot encoding. There are many tasks within graph embedding, such as node embedding, community embedding and sub-structure embedding etc. And there are also many tasks can benefit from embedding, such as community detection.
